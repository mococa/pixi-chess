# @chess/infrastructure

This is the infrastructure workspace for the chess project. It contains the necessary code to automatically
host and deploy the chess project using `pulumi` on AWS.

In the `index.ts` folder it instantiates all the stacks, which contain the necessary resources to host the
chess.
